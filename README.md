# caesar_cipher
Hi recruter, this is my Caesar Cipher app running with Sinatra ruby gem.
This is part of my self teaching using Odin Project, a web site which shows the way step-by-step until you
became a full stack web developer.
On this stage, I'm inside the way learning Ruby on Rails. Know Sinatra Ruby gem is fundamental in order to learning RoR.
The reason is because Sinatra doesn't have all staffs included in Rails. Hence we need to include it "manually".
This kind of approach force you as a developer to know what is going on under the hood on Rails.
This solidified your knowledge opening more possibilities of implementation.
